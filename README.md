# LinkedInTimeLined-WomenHackathon

The moment I read about a famous technologist, the first thing I do it search for them in LinkedIn and see from where did they start, where all did they work so as to reach here today.
Therefore I have made this chrome extension which shows the work experience of our favorite technologists in time line format.

HOW TO INSTALL THE EXTENSION:

Now to see the experience of our favorite technologists in timeline format in linkedin
1.) go to chrome://extensions in your chrome.
2.) Check te Developer mode
3.) Click on load unpacked Extensions...
4.) Navigate the folder in which you have copied the source code. That is file structure just above manifest.json.
5.) Hit Ok.
6.) Now go to Linkedin and visit the profile of your friend/technologists to see the timelined format of their experience.
